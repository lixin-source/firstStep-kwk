# firstStep

Kode With Klossy (KWK) encourages women to pursue technology through hands-on projects and collaboration. During KWK, two other scholars and I were able to collaborate to create firstStep, a website containing resources targetted towards first-generation, low-income, and/or undocumented high school, students applying to colleges in the United States.

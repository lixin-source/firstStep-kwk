<p class="scholarDescription"> Applying to college can be a very confusing and long process, especially with no guidance. firstStep presents the steps to applying to college during your senior year of highschool. These steps are crucial to follow in order for a successful transition into college. <p>
<p class="header"> <strong> First Steps to Take:
 </strong>
 <ol>
  <li> Find colleges that you are interested in attending and/or have programs that can help you pay for tuition. Separate these colleges into safety, target, and reach schools based on your statistics and the statistics of the average student that is accepted into each school. </li>
    <p> Using these colleges, it is recommended you create a 'Preliminary College List', where you include a good mix of safety, target, and reach schools that you would be happy to attend! The average student applies to 7-10 schools (2-3 reach, 3-4 target, and 2-3 safety). You can apply to as many as you want, but please be mindful that each application takes time and effort! </p>

    <p> <u>Safety School</u>: A school that you are likely to get into. Your statistics are better than the average student of that school! </p>

  </container>
  <container class='definitions'>
    <p> <u>Target School</u>: A school where your statistics are very similar to the average student! </p>
  </container>
  <container class='definitions'>
    <p> <u>Reach School</u>: A school where your statistics are lower than those of the average student! Certain colleges are reach schools for all students because of their selective nature. </p>
  </container>
</div>
  <br>
  <li> Begin researching and visiting schools of your choice virtually or with campus visits. Visit ones that you are interested in or are within your GPA/stats range. </li>
  <p> As you go through this process, make sure to make note of things that are important to you. Do you prefer a smaller college or a larger college? What field of study are you interested in and is this college a good fit for that? How is the weather? What is the student life like? How do you feel about the environment of the college? Is the food good? Is it in an urban, suburban, or rural area? Find your preferences and modify your college list! </p>
  </ol>
  <p class="header"> <strong> When Senior Year Approaches:
 </strong> </p>
 <ol start ='3'>
  <li> When applications release, review the questions on applications that have opened & brainstorm answers and topics for the personal statement and supplements. </li>

<p> Your essays are your space to explain to colleges why you are a good fit for their school and for them to get to know you beyong your transcript. Get creative, but be true to yourself! Click <a href='https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/college-essay-tips' target="_blank" class='embedded'> HERE</a> for essay writing tips and <a href='https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/college-essay-examples' target="_blank" class='embedded'> HERE</a> for some sample essays! </p>

  <li> Ask for letters of recommendation from either teachers, counselors, or people from activities you have been a part of. You want people that can speak to your abilities as a student and character. </li>

<p> Remember that the best person to ask a recommendation letter from is not necessarily the teacher of a class that you got the highest grade in. Rather, make sure to ask someone who you have formed a genuine connection. When asking, be prepared to justify why you think they are the best person to write your recommendation letter and remember that this is a favor they are doing to you! Be sure to thank them for writing your recommendation letter, and update them as college decisions come out! </p>

  <li> Confirm with guidance counselors at the high school to see if there are waivers for application submission fees. </li>

  <p> Fee waivers are also available for standardized testing, though standardized testing is optional for a lot of colleges this year! </p>

  <li> After you finish your essays and applications, reach out to alumni, professors, or people associated with colleges you applied to in order to speak about your interest at the school. </li>
</ol>
